Devil's Island is located at the northeast entrance to Halifax Harbour just off of shore of Eastern Passage. The first mention of the island historically can be found in 1711, when it was included in an early French map depicting what is now the Province of Nova Scotia.

 

The island has gone through many name changes, but it is believed that it was first known as Deville's or Duval's Island. Over the years of English habitation in the area the name was eventually anglicized and came to be known as Devil's Island. The first European settlers began a community on the island by 1830, this quickly grew to include at least 20 families, a school, and a general store. At one point there were two lighthouses and a lifesaving station based on the island; today only the southeast lighthouse remains along with a later light keeper's residence. Paranormal activity has been recorded on the island since the first settlers came to the island.
Borley Rectory was reputed to be the most haunted house in the uk. The rectory was built by the Rev. Henry D.E. bull in 1863 near the river stour, essex, to house himself, his wife and their 14 children. However the rectory burnt down in a fire started in mysterious circumstances in 1939.

 

It's thought that the rectory was destined to be a haunted house from the start due to the events that had occurred on the site many centuries before. The foundation was an age old priory on land that contained a 12th century church, caretaker's house and other buildings. a.c. henning, the rector in 1936, discovered that the doomsday book told of a borley manor prior to 1066, so he concluded a wooden church was probably also built around that time. The foundations contained underground tunnels and a complex of vault rooms. The rectory had 20 rooms, was about 3 stories high.

 On March 26th, I was on the computer at home when I heard a door open downstairs, then someone walking. My cat became very suspicious and went downstairs. He was crouched down very low, then he disappeared around the stairs, into the kitchen, and out of my sight. I then, went down two stairs with a large stick in my hand while the movement continuously went on. On the 2nd stair I made a creak by accident and I heard the footsteps begin to run towards me. I immediately ran into the computer room and locked the door.

 Hi everybody. Over the past seven years, we haven't just been recovering from crisis, we've been rebuilding our economy on a new foundation for growth-growth that benefits everybody, not just folks at the top. Our businesses have created jobs for 73 straight months-14.4 million new jobs in all. We've covered another 20 million Americans with health insurance. We've helped more Americans afford college, and invested in industries that create good jobs that pay well, like clean energy. And wages are finally rising again.

 

But there will always be more work to do. And this week, my Administration took two big steps that will help make sure your hard work is rewarded, and that everybody plays by the same rules.

 

First, we're helping more Americans retire with security and dignity. Right now, if you go to a retirement advisor for investment advice, some of them don't have to act in your best interest. Instead of telling you the best way to save your hard-earned money, these advisors can get backdoor payments from big companies for steering you toward investments that cost more and earn you less. As a result, when you retire, you might be missing out on tens of thousands of dollars-because your advisor got paid more to give you bad advice.

 

If that seems wrong, that's because it is. That's why the Department of Labor just finalized a rule to crack down on these kinds of conflicts of interest. And a lot of Wall Street special interests aren't very happy about it. But across the country, this new rule will boost working folks' retirement savings by billions of dollars a year. And it will level the playing field for the many good advisors who do work in their clients' best interest.

 

Second, the Treasury Department took action to crack down on big corporations that change their address overseas after acquiring smaller companies, in order to reduce their tax bill here at home. It's a loophole called "corporate inversion." And it means that American companies can take advantage of America's technology, America's infrastructure, America's workers-but then, when it comes to paying their fair share of taxes, suddenly claim they're not American companies after all. That's why, this week, the Treasury Department made it more difficult for companies to exploit this loophole and stick the rest of us with the tab.

 

Together, these steps build on the work we've already done to make our tax code fairer and consumer protections stronger. Because I believe that rather than double down on policies that allow a few at the top to play by their own rules, we should build an economy where everybody has a fair shot, everybody does their fair share, and everybody plays by the same set of rules.
Hi, everybody. This week, I'm speaking to you from our Nuclear Security Summit. I welcomed more than 50 leaders from around the world to make sure we're working together to meet one of the greatest threats to global security -- terrorists getting their hands on a weapon of mass destruction, like a nuclear weapon.

 

Fortunately, because of our efforts so far, no terrorist group has yet succeeded in obtaining a nuclear device or producing a dirty bomb using radioactive materials. But we know that al Qaeda has tried. ISIL has already used chemical weapons in Syria and Iraq. And if they ever got hold of a nuclear weapon or nuclear material, we have no doubt they'd use it.

 

That's why we've been leading a global effort to secure the world's nuclear materials. And with summits like this, we've made important progress. Working with other nations, we have removed or secured enough nuclear material for more than 150 nuclear weapons -- material that will now never fall into the hands of terrorists.

 

All of South America is now free of these deadly materials. Central Europe and Southeast Asia are on track to be free of them later this year. That means that as terrorists and criminal gangs look around for the deadly ingredients for a nuclear device, vast regions of the world are now off limits. This is a remarkable achievement. And at this summit, we pledged to keep up our efforts to prevent the world's most deadly networks from obtaining the world's most deadly weapons.

 

Our summit was also another opportunity to make sure the world remains united and focused on destroying ISIL. A majority of the nations who came here are part of our global coalition against ISIL. A number of our countries have been targeted by ISIL. Just about all our nations have seen citizens travel to join ISIL in Syria and Iraq.

 

In Syria and Iraq, ISIL continues to lose ground. Our coalition continues to take out its leaders, including those planning terrorist attacks against our countries. They're losing their oil infrastructure and revenues. Their morale is suffering.

 

As ISIL is squeezed in Syria and Iraq, it's lashing out elsewhere, as we've seen most recently -- and tragicallyâ€”from Turkey to Brussels. During our summit, we focused on ways to step up our efforts to disrupt terrorist attacks. It requires even more cooperation to prevent the flow of foreign terrorist fighters and sharing even more information and intelligence. That's why I invited all the nations represented at this summit to join us in a broader discussion among our intelligence and security services on how we can improve information sharing to prevent terrorist attacks.

 

This continues to be a difficult fight. But every day, our dedicated professionals -- military, diplomatic, intelligence, counterterrorism, homeland security, law enforcement, nuclear experts -- are working to protect us. Because of the progress we made this week, and over recent years, more of the world's nuclear material is secure. It's harder for terrorists to get it. And as Commander in Chief, I want you to know that we're going to keep doing everything in our power to keep our nation safe and strong and free.
 

That's what this country is all about. That's what we've been working toward these past seven years. And that's what I'm going to keep fighting for as long as I'm your President.

 

Thanks everybody. Have a great weekend.

After the footsteps were gone, I went back downstairs to find that all the doors locked. I went back upstairs into my room and locked the door. I called my mom who was in Atlantic City with her friend, who was also in the FBI, and they came over immediately. Her friend then told me that the same thing happened to him when he was 11. I later found my cat in the last place I would ever look to find him, all the way under my mom's bed and all the way in the back, scared to death.

 

When my mom's friend went home he said that he began to do some research, and it seems to happen to most teens that have someone who has died. So, it turns out that it could have been my grandmother came to visit, but who also nearly scared me to death.

The most popular story to the background of borley was that in 1362 benedictine monks built a monastery on the site which would later hold the rectory. Legend told of a nun from the bures convent, 7 miles southeast of borley falling in love with a monk from the monastery. They had decided to elope to be together, but the elders discovered their plans. a friend of the monk was to drive a carriage to help them escape. On the fateful night they were captured by the elders. The coachman was beheaded, the monk hanged and the nun was bricked up alive in the walls of the vaults beneath the rectory. Their ghosts have haunted the site ever since.

 

A former lighthouse keeper, after having just finished painting the stairs inside the lighthouse, turned to look at his handy work only to see that unexplained footsteps were left in the wet paint.

 

After a party on the island one resident caspar henneberry reported seeing a talking halibut who he claimed was the devil. The next day they found caspar hanging over the side of his boat drowned. some say this is how the island got the name "devil's island".

 

There once was a house on the island which was subject to a large amount of poltergeist activity. The property suffered mysterious fires, knockings, objects would move, disembodied voices heard, foul odors would suddenly come and go, and apparitions were witnessed by the owners and guests at the home. The house was eventually demolished. Over the last century visitors have reported seeing mysterious fires and lights where the house once stood.

 

One of the more recent experiences of a paranormal nature on the island took place in the mid 1990's. A camper visiting the island had heard that the island was haunted and wanted to put it to the test. The camper placed his tent a good distance from the light keeper's house. At night when it came time to turn out the light in the tent, he observed a light in the window of the light keeper's house. The camper walked over to the light keeper's house and ventured inside to where he had seen the light. When he went to the window sill there was a candle but it had blown out, but was still warm as if it had been blown out just seconds before. It is of interest to note that the camper walked around the island earlier to make sure he was the only one present on the island. This story is also of interest as there is no electricity on the island.

In her early days as an emergency room physician, Doctor Joanna Myer treated a child who had suffered a second degree burn. After the child had been treated and was being prepared for discharge. Doctor Myer talked to the parents about how they should care for the child at home. Also listening to her were a half a dozen other family members. A few hours later, when she came to say goodbye, the family asked her to settle an argument they'd been having over exactly what advice she had given. "As I talked to them. I was amazed." she said. "All of them had heard the simple instructions I have given just a few hours before, but they have three or four different version.The most basic details were unclear and confusing.I was surprised, because these were intelligent people." This episode gave Doctor Myer her first clue to something every doctor learns sooner or later - most people just don't listen very well. Nowadays, she says she repeats her instruction, and even conduct a reality check with some patients. She asks them to tell her what they think they are supposed to do. She also provides take-home sheets which are computer printouts tailored to the patients'situation. Doctor Myer's listeners are not unusual. When new or difficult material is presented, almost all listeners are faced with the challenge because human speech lacks the stability and permanence of the printed word.Oral communication is fast-moving andimpermanent.

The ghost of Queen Anne Boleyn is quite a unique phenomenon in the world of the paranormal. Unlike most ghost who haunt a certain locality, Queen Anne Boleyn's ghost is said to haunt a number of different locations through out the UK. Her spirit seems to have left a permanent imprint on the fabric of her surroundings, which is perhaps down to the impact she made in life and her traumatic death as to why her ghost still persists more than 500 years after her execution.

 

Anne Boleyn was the second wife of King Henry VIII, with their marriage changing the course of english history. King Henry was already married to Catherine of aragon and could not obtain a divorce from the roman catholic church. In order to obtain his divorce he therefore created a reformed version of the church, putting himself at the head - a direct challenge of authority to the pope.

 

Having obtained his divorce and married Anne, the King's most important desire was for Anne to conceive a male heir. his previous queen had only given him a female heir, Princess Mary. On 7th September 1533 Anne Boleyn gave birth to a girl, Elizabeth (who was later to become Queen Elizabeth I). After her birth, the relationship between the King and Anne Boleyn deteriorated, and he began to court a new queen in Jane Seymour.

 

However, Anne became pregnant again, and there was a brief reconciliation, but the child was stillborn. Henry determined to get rid of Anne Boleyn and came up with a charge of treason, arresting and confining her to the tower of london. Her execution had been scheduled for 18 May 1536 but actually took place the following day as there had been a delay while a skilled executioner was brought in from France.

 

Queen anne boleyn is one of the most enduring ghosts at the tower of London. Queen Anne is buried under the chapel's altar, with her ghost being spotted there on many occasions. Anne Boleyn has also often been seen standing at the window in the dean's cloister at windsor castle.

 

Anne Boleyn's ghost also appears in the grounds of blickling hall dressed all in white, seated in a ghostly carriage that is drawn by headless horses, spurred on by a headless coachman. Anne too is headless, holding her severed head securely in her lap. On arrival at blickling hall the coach and driver vanish leaving the headless Anne to glide alone into blickling hall where she roams the corridors and rooms until daybreak.

 

The magnificent blickling hall was built during the reign of King James I, by the holbert family, on the ruins of the old boleyn family property. Blickling hall in norfolk has recently topped a national trust poll as the trust's most haunted building. Blickling hall was in the possession of the Boleyn family between 1499 and 1507. There is a statue and portrait of Anne Boleyn in the hall, the statue is inscribed "Anna Bolena born here 1507".

 

Her brother, lord rochford, also appears on the same night, he too is headless although he doesn't enjoy the comfort of a carriage, for he is dragged across the surrounding countryside by four headless horses.

 Mitre Square is now surrounded on three sides by modern office blocks and bordered on its south side by the Sir John Cass foundation school. Nothing remains of the victorian square, except a few cobblestones across which people hurry on their way to and from work, not giving a thought that they are walking over the spot where one of london's most infamous crimes occurred.

 

Catherine Eddowes was the second victim of the night of Sunday 30 September 1888, a night which already had seen the killing of Elizabeth Stride less than an hour earlier. These two murders are commonly referred to as the "double event" and have been attributed to the serial Killer Jack the ripper.

 

It was in the south-west corner of mitre square that the horribly mutilated body of Catherine Eddowes was found, the fourth victim of "jack the ripper". The body was discovered at 1.45am on the 30th september 1888.local tradition maintains that on the anniversary of the killing, people have occasionally glimpsed catherine's ghostly figure lying upon the spot where her life came to such a tragic and gruesome end. The photograph of mitre square to the right was taken last year during a jack the ripper ghost walk it shows a ghostly white mist.

 

In the days of the brewery it was often noticed that a strange chill drifted through the boardroom at 6am on the anniversary of the murder and it was also reported that annie chapman's headless ghost was sometimes seen standing by the wall of the storeroom that occupied the spot where she died.

Sir Thomas Boleyn, who stated his belief of anne's guilt at her trial has not found peace in death. Every year, for a thousand years to do as penance, tradition says he is obliged to drive his spectral coach and horses over twelve bridges that lie between wroxham and blickling.
